ðŸ§ª **TestBuddy** is an intelligent question-answering chatbot designed to assist with software testing-related queries. Built using Streamlit for the web interface, Sentence Transformers for semantic text embeddings, and FAISS for fast similarity search.

You can run the app locally or deploy it on [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) to share a live version.

How it Works
embedder.py reads questions from qa_knowledge.json, encodes them into vectors using SentenceTransformer, and builds a FAISS index saved as vector_index.faiss.

chatbot.py loads this index and questions, encodes the user's input, and retrieves the closest matching answer.

app.py runs a Streamlit web app that takes user input and shows the corresponding answer.

Features

- Semantic search-based question answering using Sentence Transformers and FAISS
- Simple and user-friendly web interface with Streamlit
- Supports software testing-related questions with accurate answers from a predefined knowledge base
- Lightweight and fast response time
